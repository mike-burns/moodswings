Mood blogging. By analogy: in the beginning was the Web page, and it was long; 
then came the blog post, and it was shorter; then came Tumblr, and it was 
shorter yet; then Twitter, and it was down to 140 characters.

The next progression is a symbol. In this case, an emotion or mood represented 
by an image or emoticon.

That is moodswings.
